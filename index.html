      <h2>What Strata is for</h2>
      <div class="purpose-body">
        <p>Strata is where thinking goes when it won't settle.</p>
        <p>Some thoughts loop. Some decisions sit unresolved for days. Some ideas aren't ready to be acted on, filed, or forgotten. They just need somewhere to exist without pressure.</p>
        <p>Strata gives you a place to write those things down — not to store them, but to stop carrying them. Each entry is named by what kind of thinking it is, not where it belongs. You're not organizing information. You're observing the shape of what's on your mind.</p>
        <p>The point isn't to remember. It's to let go.</p>

  <!-- STRUCTURE, NOT FEATURES -->
  <section class="structure" aria-label="Structure">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Structure, not features</h2>
      <p class="structure-intro">Strata uses six cognitive structures. These are not categories or tags. They name the state of your thinking.</p>
      <div class="structure-grid">
        <div class="structure-item">
          <h3>Thought</h3>
          <p>Something surfacing. Not yet shaped, not yet directed. Present, but unnamed until now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="structure-item">
          <h3>Idea</h3>
          <p>Something with potential. It may lead somewhere, or it may not. It exists to be held, not executed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="structure-item">
          <h3>Question</h3>
          <p>Something unresolved. Not a search query. A real question — the kind that stays with you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="structure-item">
          <h3>Decision</h3>
          <p>Something forming. Not yet made, but pressing. A space to watch it take shape without forcing it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="structure-item">
          <h3>System</h3>
          <p>Something recurring. A pattern, a process, a loop. Named so it can be seen clearly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="structure-item">
          <h3>Insight</h3>
          <p>Something that arrived. Not learned — realized. Worth writing down before it fades.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="structure-note">You choose a structure to name the state of your thinking. Strata reflects that back to you. Nothing is forced to become action.</p>

      <h2>Why local-first</h2>
      <div class="local-body">
        <p>Your data lives on your machine. The files are plain and readable. There are no accounts, no cloud sync, no external dependencies.</p>
        <p>This means your thinking stays yours. It isn't processed, analyzed, or stored elsewhere. If you stop using Strata, your files remain exactly where they are, in a format you can open with anything.</p>
        <p>No lock-in. No dependency. Just files on your computer.</p>
